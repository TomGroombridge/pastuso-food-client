        <li>
          First infuse the milk to make the béchamel sauce. Put the 1 ½ litres milk, 1 thickly sliced onion, 3 bay leaves and 3 cloves into a large saucepan and bring very gently just up to the boil. Turn off the heat and set aside for 1 hr to infuse.
        </li>
        <li>For the meat sauce, put the 3 tbsp oil, 2 finely chopped celery sticks, 1 finely chopped onion, 1 finely chopped carrot, 3 crushed garlic cloves and 140g cubed pancetta in another large saucepan. Gently cook together until the veg are soft but not coloured</li>
        <li>Tip in 500g pork mince and 500g beef mince, 200ml milk and 2 cans of chopped tomatoes. Using a wooden spoon, stir together and break up and mash the lumps of mince against the sides of the pan.</li>
        <li>When the mince is mostly broken down, stir in 2 bay leaves, 1 rosemary sprig, 2 thyme sprigs, 2 tsp dried oregano, 2 beef stock cubes and 500ml red wine, and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Cover and cook for 1 hr, stirring occasionally to stop the bottom catching.</li>
        <li>Uncover and gently simmer for another 30 mins-1 hr until the meat is tender and saucy. Taste and season.</li>
        <li>To finish the béchamel sauce, strain the milk through a fine sieve into one or two jugs.</li>
        <li>Melt 100g butter in the same pan then, using a wooden spoon, mix in 100g plain flour and cook for 2 mins.</li>
        <li>Stir in the strained milk, a little at a time – the mix will thicken at first to a doughy paste, but keep going, adding milk gradually to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>When all the milk is in, bring to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly (if you have lumps, give it a quick whisk). Gently bubble for a few mins until thickened.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper and a good grating of nutmeg.</li>
        <li>Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
        <li>Spread a spoonful of the meat sauce over the base of a roughly 3.5 litre baking dish.</li>
        <li>Cover with a single layer of dried pasta sheets, snapping them to fit if needed, then top with a quarter of the béchamel. Spoon over a third of the meat sauce and scatter over a little of the finely grated parmesan.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layers – pasta, béchamel, meat and parmesan – two more times to use all the meat sauce. Add a final layer of pasta, the last of the béchamel and remaining parmesan.</li>
        <li>Sit the dish on a baking tray to catch spills and bake for 1 hr until bubbling, browned and crisp on top.</li>
